- use descriptor for computed properties
- getter setter should emit events
- auto dependency extraction for computed properties (evaluate, record triggered getters)

- parse textNodes?
- more directives / filters
    - sd-if
    - sd-with
    - sd-visible
    - sd-style
- nested properties in scope (kinda hard, maybe later)
