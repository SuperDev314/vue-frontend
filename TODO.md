- getter setter should emit events
- auto dependency extraction for computed properties (evaluate, record triggered getters)
- use descriptor for computed properties

- parse textNodes?
- limited set of expressions (e.g. ternary operator)
- more directives / filters
    - sd-if
    - sd-route
- nested properties in scope (kinda hard, maybe later)
