- nested properties in scope
    - parse path in Directive parser
    - select scope to defineProperty on based on path, create object if needed
    - when a new object is set, recursively replace all properties with getter/setters that emit events.
- sd-with
- standarized way to reuse components (sd-component?)
- plugins: seed-touch, seed-storage, seed-router
