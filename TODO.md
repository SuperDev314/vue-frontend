- change the name to one that no one has used before...
- change the exposed var to a single one (capitalized constructor)
- change the default prefix to a single letter (depending on new name)
- change `sd-each` to `s-repeat`
- put all API methods on Seed
- add a method to observe additional data properties
- add `lazy` option
- add directive for all form elements, and make it consistent as `s-model`
- add escape: {{{ things in here should not be parsed }}}
- rename `props` option to `proto`
- properties that start with `_` should also be ignored and used as a convention: `$` is library properties, `_` is user properties and non-prefixed properties are data.
