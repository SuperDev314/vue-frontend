 * Setup the binding tree.

 * Bindings form a tree-like structure that maps the Object structure
 * of observed data. However, only paths present in the templates are
 * created in the binding tree. When a change event from the data 
 * observer arrives on the instance, we traverse the binding tree
 * along the changed path, triggering binding updates along the way.
 * When we reach the path endpoint, if it has any children, we also
 * trigger updates on the entire sub-tree.
 *
 * Each instance has a root binding and it has three special children:
 * `$data`, `$parent` & `$root`. `$data` points to the root binding
 * itself. `$parent` and `$root` point to the instance's parent and
 * root's root bindings, respectively.
