# Seed (WIP)
## a mini MVVM framework

- 7kb gzipped, no dependency.
- DOM based templates with precise and efficient manipulation
- POJSO (Plain Old JavaScript Objects) Models FTW - even nested objects.
- Logic-less templating which enforces separation of concerns.
- Auto dependency extraction for computed properties.
- Computed properties can have dynamic context.
- Auto event delegation on repeated items.
- [Component](https://github.com/component/component) based, can be used as a CommonJS module but can also be used alone.
