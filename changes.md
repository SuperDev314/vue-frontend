If you happen to see this - note that most of these are just planned but subject to change at any moment. Feedback is welcome though.

## Instantiation

**If no `el` option is provided** at instantiation, Vue will no longer auto-create an empty div for you. In this case, the instance is considered to be in "unmounted" state. Data will be observed, but no DOM compilation will happen until the new instance method `$mount` has been explicitly called.

``` js
var vm = new Vue({ data: {a:1} }) // only observes the data
vm.$mount('#app') // actually compile the DOM

// in comparison, this will compile instantly just like before.
var vm = new Vue({ el: '#app', data: {a: 1} })
```

## New Scope Inheritance Model

In the previous version, nested Vue instances do not have prototypal inheritance of their data scope. Although you can access parent data properties in templates, you need to explicitly travel up the scope chain with `this.$parent` in JavaScript code or use `this.$get()` to get a property on the scope chain. The expression parser also needs to do a lot of dirty work to determine the correct scope the variables belong to.

In the new model, we provide a scope inehritance system similar to Angular, in which you can directly access properties that exist on parent scopes. The major difference is that setting a primitive value property on a child scope WILL affect that on the parent scope! This is one of the major gotchas in Angular. If you are somewhat familiar with how prototype inehritance works, you might be surprised how this is possible. Well, the reason is that all data properties in Vue are getter/setters, and invoking a setter will not cause the child scope shadowing parent scopes. See the example [here](http://jsfiddle.net/yyx990803/Px2n6/).

The result of this model is a much cleaner expression evaluation implementation. All expressions can simply be evaluated with the vm's `$scope` as the `this` context.

This is very useful, but it probably should only be available in implicit child instances created by flow-control directives like `v-repeat`, `v-if`, etc. Explicit components should retain its own root scope and use some sort of two way binding like `v-with` to bind to data from outer scope.

## Option changes

### instance-only options

`el`, `parent` and `data` are now instance-only options - that means they should not be used and will be ignored in `Vue.extend()`.

It's probably easy to understand why `el` and `parent` are instance only. But why `data`? Because it's really easy to shoot yourself in the foot when you use `data` in `Vue.extend()`. Non-primitive values will be shared by reference across all instances created from that constructor, and changing it from one instance will affect the state of all the others! It's a bit like shared properties on the prototype. In vanilla javascript, the proper way to initialize instance data is to do so in the constructor: `this.someData = {}`. Similarly in Vue, you can do so in the `created` hook by setting `this.$data.someData = {}`.

### new option: `syncData`.

A side effect of the new scope/data model is that the `data` object being passed in is no longer mutated by default, because all its properties are copied into the scope instead, and the scope is now the source of truth. To sync changes to the scope back to the original data object, you need to now explicitly pass in  `syncData: true` in the options. In most cases, this is not necessary, but you do need to be aware of this.

### new option: `events`.

When events are used extensively for cross-vm communication, the ready hook can get kinda messy. The new `events` option is similar to its Backbone equivalent, where you can declaratiely register a bunch of event listeners.

### removed options: `id`, `tagName`, `className`, `attributes`, `lazy`.

Since now a vm must always be provided the `el` option or explicitly mounted to an existing element, the element creation releated options have been removed for simplicity. If you need to modify your element's attributes, simply do so in the new `beforeMount` hook.

The `lazy` option is removed because this does not belong at the vm level. Users should be able to configure individual `v-model` instances to be lazy or not.

## Hook changes

### new hook: `beforeMount`

This new hook is introduced to accompany the separation of instantiation and DOM mounting. It is called right before the DOM compilation starts and `this.$el` is available, so you can do some pre-processing on the element here.

### removed hooks: `attached` & `detached`

These two have caused confusions about when they'd actually fire, and proper use cases seem to be rare. Let me know if you have important use cases for these two hooks.

## Two Way filters

If a filter is defined as a function, it is treated as a read filter by default - i.e. it is applied when data is read from the model and applied to the DOM. You can now specify write filters as well, which are applied when writing to the model, triggered by user input. Write filters are only triggered on two-way bindings like `v-model`.

``` js
Vue.filter('format', {
  read: function (val) {
    return val + '!'
  },
  write: function (val, oldVal) {
    return val.match(/ok/) ? val : oldVal
  }
})
```

## Block logic control

``` html
<!-- v-repeat="list" -->
  <h2>{{title}}</h2>
  <p>{{content}}</p>
<!-- v-repeat-end -->
```

``` html
<!-- v-if="showProfile" -->
  <my-avatar></my-avatar>
  <my-bio></my-bio>
<!-- v-if-end -->
```

## (Experimental) Validators

This is largely write filters that accept a Boolean return value. Probably should live as a plugin.

``` html
  <input v-model="abc @ email">
```

``` js
  Vue.validator('email', function (val) {
    return val.match(...)
  })
  // this.$validation.abc // false
  // this.$valid // false
```

## (Experimental) One time interpolations

``` html
<span>{{* hello }}</span>
```
